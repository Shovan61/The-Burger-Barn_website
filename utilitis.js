Even though theyre not as colorful as traditionally antioxidant-rich fruits, theyre still full of them. Black beans are a great source of anthocyanins, which are antioxidant compounds that can boost your brain power. Plus, a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found black beans, gram for gram, have more antioxidant activity than other beans. (Those antioxidants are great for destroying free radicals, which are linked to cancer, heart disease, and aging.Black bean burgers are almost perfect.
